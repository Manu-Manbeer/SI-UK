***********************BELOW IS THE PROBLEM STATEMENTS WHICH GIVEN TO ME*********************

Create a class of student that stores characteristics of a student, such as studentID,
studentName, studentDOB, studentNumber, studentEmail, studentGPA of the last 5
semesters for each student
•	Calculate the overall GPA of each student using the function calculateCGPA(…).
•	The student with the highest overall GPA will be considerd Valedictorian of the class.
•	There should be a function that will compare the overall GPA of students and will
•	declare the student with the highest overall GPA as Valedictorian.
•	The program should be able to take input of 5 students from the user.
•	Use a Setter for setting the values of the data members of the class and a Getter
•	function for getting the values of the data members of the class. (You can use a property as an alternative.).
•	The default value for each student's GPA should be 3.0. (You need to use an array for
•	storing GPAs of the last 5 semesters. You may simply initialize the array with 3.0 in the
•	constructor).
•	All data members should be private.
•	Member functions can be public.
•	The program must be able to add two objects. In other words if we add two students
•	then all their corresponding data members will be added one by one. (Operator
•	Overloading).
•	The program must contain an explicitly defined copy constructor.
•	StudentID and StudentGPA of the last 5 semesters must be constant or readonly.
•	The value of studentGPA of the last 5 semesters must be selected from a enum that
may contain values {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0}.
